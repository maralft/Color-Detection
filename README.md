# Color Detection with Python

This project is a Python-based color detection tool that uses OpenCV to detect colors in an image.

## Features

- Detects the dominant colors in an image.
- Provides the color name and RGB values for the detected colors.
- Works with various image formats.

## Prerequisites

Before using this color detection tool, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)

You can install OpenCV using pip:

`pip install opencv-python`


## How It Works
The color detection tool uses OpenCV to read the input image and allows you to select colors by double-clicking on the image. The tool then displays the color name and RGB values for the selected colors. It uses a CSV file containing color names and corresponding RGB values to identify the closest matching color for the selected pixel.
